# execution-environments-host

[中文说明](README_ZH.md)

Standalone createEnvironmentRegistry and createHostEnvironment factories. The registry retains original leases and provider retirement responsibility. The built-in host advertises no command or file facility, OS backend, or sandbox isolation.

## Public entries

The root exports public types and standalone functions. `./cordis` contains the integration binding. Import each through its explicit package export.

- [Root exports](src/index.ts)
- [Cordis](src/cordis.ts)

Behavior beyond types belongs to [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

The template marker reports structural adoption. It does not establish complete business or lifecycle acceptance.
