# test-runner

[中文说明](README_ZH.md)

The test runner plans member builds, type checks, tests and acceptance from the change set, runs them (member tests through turbo, acceptance member by member), and writes timing ledgers. It also runs differential mutation testing. The rules are in [`test-runs.config.json`](test-runs.config.json). This member is not published. It is removed after turbo takes over its work. `@omne-harness/repo-toolchain` defines the ledger read format in `core/test-ledger`; the clean loop and the health page read ledgers through it.

See the [Chinese guide](README_ZH.md) for the plan rules, tiers, ledgers and mutation testing.
